ToDo:
- Implement trees
- Point system that scores up when player places a tile that matches neighboring tiles and extra points for the higher the building
- Add variability to the elementPrefab so class
- Intro screen
- HUD for points and stuff
- Audio manager for placing tiles / points etc
- (maybe) preview rotates with player to show better how it will be placed
- Make the ghost boxes more subtle
- Path parts
- Castle wall parts
- Unique structures (windmill, well, statues, etc)
-
